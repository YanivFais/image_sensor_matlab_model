CMOS Image sensor project
--------------------------

This directory contains the Matlab source code and necessary data file (no scenes), 
PowerPoint presentation with project details and Word Document with specific Semiconductor calculations.

In order to run this project you need to place the scene4 and scene6 directories in parallel to this directory (i.e. one directory up from here).
The project main file is called main.m , this project runs the setup file (which loads the data) and then processes SOC according to the different configurations and inputs.

SOC uses CIS and ISP main files.
Notice since the Bilateral filter is uses C-MEX file for performance you will need to compile it, this is the first step in the "setup" file however a C compiler is required in the system for this.
The project has been tested with MatLab2009a.

The output images are organized in the following way , for each scene there is separate zip file and directory, inside such directory the output images have the following naming convention:
_ADC suffix : output from Analog to Digital converter
_demosaicing suffix : output after demosaicing
_final suffix : final SOC output after ISP

moreover each scene has the following convention:
_ideal : for Ideal settings without noise and full exposure
_noise : 100% exposure with noise
_10 : 100% exposure
_1a,_1b,_1c : 1% exposure 3 random runs

For example:
scene4_1b_final - input is scene4 , setting is 1% exposure with noise (2'nd random run) , the output is after ISP
