% Graphical User Interfaces
%   demoGUI           - main program
%   generation        - generate a set of low resolution shifted and 
%                       rotated RAW images, simulated from a single input image
%
% Image Registration
%   estimate_motion   - shift and rotation estimation using algorithm 
%                       by Vandewalle et al.
%   estimate_rotation - rotation estimation using algorithm by Vandewalle et al.
%   estimate_shift    - shift estimation using algorithm by Vandewalle et al.
%
% Image Reconstruction and/or Demosaicing
%   bilinear_demosaicing - reconstruct a high resolution image from a set of 
%                       low resolution images and their registration parameters
%                       using bilinear interpolation
%   demos_freq_adapt_SPL - reconstruct an RGB image from a single RAW image using the 
%                       adaptive frequency selection method by Dubois
%   duboiscombined    - reconstruct a high resolution image from a set of 
%                       low resolution RAW images and their registration parameters
%                       using a combined super-resolution and demosaicing by Dubois
%   EPFLDemosaicing   - reconstruct an RGB image from a single RAW image using the 
%                       frequency selection method by Alleysson et al.
%   FreqSelDemosaic   - reconstruct a high resolution image from a set of 
%                       low resolution RAW images and their registration parameters
%                       using the frequency selection method by Alleysson et al.
%   interpolation     - reconstruct a high resolution image from a set of 
%                       low resolution images and their registration parameters
%                       using bicubic interpolation
%   n_conv (and n_convolution) - reconstruct a high resolution image from a set
%                       of low resolution images and their registration parameters
%                       using algorithm by Pham et al. n_conv calls n_convolution

%                       low resolution RAW images and their registration parameters
%                       using combined super-resolution and demosaicing. Method proposed
%                       in this paper (Vandewalle et al. 07)
%
% Helper Functions
%   c2p               - compute the polar coordinates of the pixels of an image
%   CFAMasks          - define the CFA filter to be used
%   cls               - clear workspace, close all windows (including hidden ones)
%   cpsnr_calc        - compute the color PSNR from two RGB images
%   create_simulated_RAW_images - generate a simulated set of shifted and rotated RAW images
%                       a single RGB image
%   demos_adapt_filters.mat - luminance/chrominance separation filter used by Dubois
%   gammaCorr         - apply gamma correction to a given image
%   process_script.m  - example script that enables background processing of large images, 
%                       bypassing the GUI (used to generate most results from the paper)
%   sep_filter.mat    - luminance/chrominance separation filter used by Alleysson et al.
%   shift             - shift an image over a non-integer amount of pixels

%   gray_logo.tif     - gray square
%   logo_epfl_small.tif - EPFL logo
%   logo_warning.tif  - warning logo
